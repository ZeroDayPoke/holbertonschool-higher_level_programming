# 0x00. Python - Hello, World

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. In this project, you will learn about the basics of the Python programming language.

## Synopsis

This project covers:

- How to print text and variables using `print`
- How to use strings
- What are indexing and slicing in Python
- What is the official Holberton Python coding style and how to check your code with `PEP 8`

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the `PEP 8` style (version 2.7.*)
- All your files must be executable

- `5-print_comb2.py`: This Python script prints numbers from 0 to 99, separated by a comma followed by a space.
- `6-print_comb3.py`: This Python script prints all possible different combinations of two digits, separated by a comma followed by a space.
