# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. In this project, you will learn about Python, its syntax, and how to write and execute Python scripts.

## Synopsis

This project covers:

- What are the if, else, and loop structures in Python
- How to use them
- How to use functions
- The correct syntax for writing Python code

## File Descriptions

- `2-print_alphabet.py`: A program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line. It uses only one print function with string format and one loop. It does not store characters in a variable and does not import any module.

- `3-print_alphabt.py`: A program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line, excluding the letters q and e. It uses only one print function with string format and one loop. It does not store characters in a variable and does not import any module.

- `7-islower.py`: A function that checks for lowercase character. It returns True if the character is lowercase and False otherwise. It does not import any module and does not use str.upper() and str.isupper().

- `8-uppercase.py`: A function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line. It uses no more than 2 print functions with string format and one loop. It does not import any module and does not use str.upper() and str.isupper().

- `9-print_last_digit.py`: A function that prints the last digit of a number. It returns the value of the last digit and does not import any module.

- `12-fizzbuzz.py`: A function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space. For multiples of three it prints "Fizz" instead of the number and for multiples of five it prints "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five it prints "FizzBuzz".
