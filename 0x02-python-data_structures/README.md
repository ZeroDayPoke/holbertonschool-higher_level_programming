# 0x02. Python - Data Structures

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. In this project, you will learn about Python data structures, including lists and tuples.

## Synopsis

This project covers:

- What are lists and how to use them
- What are tuples and how to use them
- What are list comprehensions and how to use them
- What are tuples and how to use them
- Whatâ€™s the difference between strings, lists and tuples
- How to use lists as stacks and queues
- What are list comprehensions and how to use them
- What are the built-in functions `map`, `reduce` and `filter`
- How to use linked lists in Python

## File Descriptions

- `0-print_list_integer.py`: A function that prints all integers of a list.
- `1-element_at.py`: A function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
- `2-replace_in_list.py`: A function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).
- `3-print_reversed_list_integer.py`: A function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
- `4-new_in_list.py`: A function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).
- `5-no_c.py`: A function that removes all characters `c` and `C` from a string.
- `6-print_matrix_integer.py`: A function that prints a matrix of integers.
- `7-add_tuple.py`: A function that adds 2 tuples.
- `8-multiple_returns.py`: A function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.
- `9-max_integer.py`: A function that finds the biggest integer of a list.
- `10-divisible_by_2.py`: A function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.
- `11-delete_at.py`: A function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.
- `12-switch.py`: A function that switches the values of `a` and `b`.
