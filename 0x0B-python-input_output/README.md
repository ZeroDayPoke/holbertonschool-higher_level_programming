# 0x0B. Python - Input/Output

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. In this project, you will learn about Python input and output, how to read and write files, and how to manipulate JSON data.

## Synopsis

This project covers:

- How to open a file
- How to write text in a file
- How to read the full content of a file
- How to read a file line by line
- How to move the cursor in a file
- How to make sure a file is closed after you use it
- What is and how to use the `with` statement
- What is `JSON`
- What is serialization
- What is deserialization
- How to convert a Python data structure to a JSON string
- How to convert a JSON string to a Python data structure

## File Descriptions

- `0-read_file.py`: A function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout. [Link to file](https://github.com/ZeroDayPoke/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-python-input_output/0-read_file.py)

- `1-write_file.py`: A function that writes a string to a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters written. [Link to file](https://github.com/ZeroDayPoke/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-python-input_output/1-write_file.py)

- `2-append_write.py`: A function that appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added. [Link to file](https://github.com/ZeroDayPoke/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-python-input_output/2-append_write.py)

- `3-to_json_string.py`: A function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string). [Link to file](https://github.com/ZeroDayPoke/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-python-input_output/3-to_json_string.py)

- `4-from_json_string.py`: A function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string. [Link to file](https://github.com/ZeroDayPoke/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-python-input_output/4-from_json_string.py)

- `5-save_to_json_file.py`: A function that writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation. [Link to file](https://github.com/ZeroDayPoke/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-python-input_output/5-save_to_json_file.py)

- `6-load_from_json_file.py`: A function that creates an Object from a "JSON file". [Link to file](https://github.com/ZeroDayPoke/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-python-input_output/6-load_from_json_file.py)

- `7-add_item.py`: A script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to a file. [Link to file](https://github.com/ZeroDayPoke/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-python-input_output/7-add_item.py)

- `8-class_to_json.py`: A function that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure (list, dictionary, string, integer and boolean) for JSON serialization of an object. [Link to file](https://github.com/ZeroDayPoke/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-python-input_output/8-class_to_json.py)

- `9-student.py`: A class `Student` that defines a student by: first name, last name and age. [Link to file](https://github.com/ZeroDayPoke/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-python-input_output/9-student.py)

- `10-student.py`: A class `Student` that defines a student (based on `9-student.py`). [Link to file](https://github.com/ZeroDayPoke/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-python-input_output/10-student.py)

- `11-student.py`: A class `Student` that defines a student (based on `10-student.py`). [Link to file](https://github.com/ZeroDayPoke/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-python-input_output/11-student.py)

- `12-pascal_triangle.py`: A function `def pascal_triangle(n):` that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascalâ€™s triangle of n. [Link to file](https://github.com/ZeroDayPoke/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-python-input_output/12-pascal_triangle.py)

- `100-append_after.py`: A function that inserts a line of text to a file, after each line containing a specific string. [Link to file](https://github.com/ZeroDayPoke/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-python-input_output/100-append_after.py)

- `101-stats.py`: A script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics. It prints statistics every 10 lines and after a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C). The statistics include total file size and number of lines by status code.
